Title: Projects

###Professional
All of my serious work has been proprietary. But it's mostly involved the processing and analysing large volumes of data.

The best visible example is [LinerNotes](http://www.linernotes.com) which I conceived, designed, and coded almost entirely by myself.

###For fun
I've also participated in a number of hackathons. I've open sourced a few of my hacks:

* [*Flow*](https://github.com/rogueleaderr/flow), a website that helps you write lyrics
* [*Videodrome*](https://github.com/rogueleaderr/videodrome), a HypeMachine knockoff that aggregates music videos
* [*GrooveJoin*](https://github.com/rogueleaderr/GrooveJoin), a Spotify app that generates a playlist that two different people will both like

And I'm keeping a few closed (until someone bothers to ask me to open them):

* *Craigslist v2.0*, a marketplace for stuff
* *ExtraExtra*, A/B testing for blog headlines
* *Lazy Pin*, a system passively collecting images to pin to Pinterest

I also wrote an extremely simple but useful tool for dividing up cleaning responsibilities among your roommates.

* [ZoneClean](https://github.com/rogueleaderr/zone-clean)

**In case you came here feeling evaluatory, please note that all the linked-to projects were for hackathons and prioritize "get it done" to the near total exclusion of "do it well".**
