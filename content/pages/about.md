Title: About Me

I believe that bad decisions cause big problems. So I build tools that help people make better decisions.

Right now, I'm working on [LinerNotes.com](http://www.linernotes.com), an AI system that helps you explore and discover music.

Online, I mostly go by **rogueleaderr** <a href='../posts/2013/09/why_rogueleaderr/index.html'>(learn why)</a>.

###Biography
Once upon a time I was a fencer and aspiring philosopher.  After that, I was an analyst at a [rather large hedge fund](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/07/25/110725fa_fact_cassidy).  Most recently, I've become a programmer and an entrepreneur.

So basically I'm a huge nerd with varied interests.

I love Brooklyn.

###Tools
I prefer Python/Django but I'm proficient in Java, Javascript, HTML and CSS/LESS. I've also worked with a *wide* variety of databases and NoSQL stores.

I use zsh for my terminal, emacs in my terminal, PyCharm for Python, Eclipse for Java, and SublimeText for everything else.

I blog in Markdown using emacs on a desktop or Write on an iPhone. This site is built using Pelican and hosted on Github pages.

I rock a Macbook Pro with external Kensington keyboard, wireless mouse, and a big ol' widescreen external monitor.

I use Dropbox and CrashPlan to save my files (double indemnity), Alfred and DashExpander to save some time, and F.lux to save my [superchiasmatic nucleus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suprachiasmatic_nucleus).
