<p><span>Finding a technical co-founder for a new startup is notoriously hard. After struggling with it for a while, I decided to figure out exactly how hard it is.</span></p>
<p>To do that I simply estimated how many needles there are in the co-founder haystack. The answer is discouraging but intuitively accurate: <strong>there are only about two thousand potential co-founders in the entire United States.</strong></p>
<h3>How hard? Let&#8217;s use <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/h5e/fermi_estimates/" target="_blank">Fermi Estimation</a></h3>
<p>In Fermi estimation, we wave our hands and spin <em>minimal knowledge</em> into <em>approximate truth</em>. The goal is to quicky get an estimate that&#8217;s close enough to correct for our purposes. For a link-bait blog post, &#8220;close enough&#8221; is not very close at all. And that&#8217;s close enoughÂ®.</p>
<p>We do Fermi estimation by breaking down our final quantity (number of viable co-founders) into a chain of constituent quantities. I model the problem like this:</p>
<p>Viable co-founders =</p>
<p>(% of programmers who are 2 standard deviations above the mean)</p>
<p>* (total number of programmers in the world)</p>
<p>* (% of world population living in the USA)</p>
<p>* (% of Americans in a startup approriate age-range)</p>
<p>* (% of programmers who know a given technology)</p>
<p>Now we basically just guess each of those quantities (with a Google sense check if possible)</p>
<p>% of programmers who are 2 standard deviations above the mean = 2.5% (by math)</p>
<p>total number of programmers = 25 million (number of StackOverflow accounts)</p>
<p>% of world programmers in the USA = 5% (US pop as % of world pop)<a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=us+population+as+%25+of+world+population" target="_blank">[1]</a></p>
<p>% of Americans in a startup approriate age-range = 20% <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080922082037AAjHFNn" target="_blank">[2]</a></p>
<p>% of programmers who know a given technology = 30% (guess)</p>
<h3>Now run the numbers:</h3>
<p>Okay, so that all adds up to:</p>
<p>2.5% * 25,000,000 * 5% * 20% * 30% = <em>drum roll</em> <strong>1875</strong></p>
<p>So that&#8217;s it! Out of a US population of 319 million, <strong>a mere ~2000 people are viable co-founders</strong>. That&#8217;s just 1 in 1.5 million people.</p>
<h3>Dang that&#8217;s hard.</h3>
<p>Then factor in the fact that the vast majority of great programmers are already employed (or 3 years into starting their own succesful company), and that only a small % will have your same interests and a compatible personality. It becomes easy to see why <em>so many</em> startups deliver bad technology or are torn apart by co-founder conflicts.</p>
<p>So&#8230;good luck!</p>
