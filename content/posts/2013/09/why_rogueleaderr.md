Well, a few reasons:

1. Google is firmly convinced that "George London" is a [long-dead opera singer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_London_(bass-baritone)).
2. "glondon", "georgel", and "londong" all sound dirty.
3. Rogueleader with one "r" was taken.
3. Because I'm a galactic fighter pilot. Pew. Pew. Pew.
